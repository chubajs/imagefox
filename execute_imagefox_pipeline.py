easyJet pilot suspended in Cape Verde after public drunkenness incident
Airline confirms immediate suspension following alcohol-related incident at resort

By Sarah Mitchell, Aviation Correspondent
Published: August 30, 2025

An easyJet pilot has been suspended after allegedly being found drunk in public at a Cape Verde resort, just hours before he was scheduled to operate a return flight to London Gatwick. The incident, which occurred at the popular Santa Maria beach resort on the island of Sal, has prompted immediate action from the airline and raised questions about pilot wellness and industry oversight.

Local authorities reported that the pilot, whose identity has not been released, was discovered in an intoxicated state at approximately 3 AM local time on Thursday morning. Hotel security staff alerted police after finding the individual behaving erratically in the resort's pool area. The pilot was scheduled to operate flight EZY1234, departing at 10:30 AM for the seven-hour journey back to the UK.

"We can confirm that a crew member has been suspended pending investigation following an incident in Cape Verde," an easyJet spokesperson stated. "The safety and wellbeing of our passengers and crew is our highest priority. We have a zero-tolerance policy toward alcohol misuse and are taking this matter extremely seriously."

The airline acted swiftly to arrange alternative crew for the affected flight, which departed with a delay of approximately four hours. Passengers were provided with refreshments and compensation in line with EU regulations. Several travelers expressed concern upon learning about the incident, though praised the airline's transparent communication and swift response.

This incident occurs against a backdrop of increased scrutiny on pilot mental health and substance abuse within the aviation industry. Recent studies by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) indicate that while incidents involving pilot intoxication remain extremely rare – occurring in less than 0.01% of flights globally – the consequences can be severe both for safety and airline reputation.

Captain Timothy Richardson, a senior pilot and aviation safety consultant, emphasized the industry's typically robust safeguards: "Modern aviation has multiple layers of protection, including random testing, peer reporting systems, and strict regulatory oversight. When these rare incidents do occur, they're dealt with swiftly and seriously."

The UK Civil Aviation Authority requires pilots to abstain from alcohol for at least eight hours before flying, though many airlines impose stricter policies. Blood alcohol limits for pilots are set at 20mg per 100ml – a quarter of the drink-drive limit in England and Wales. Violations can result in immediate license suspension, criminal prosecution, and career termination.

Industry experts note that the pressures of modern aviation – including irregular schedules, time zone changes, and extended periods away from home – can contribute to stress and potentially problematic behaviors. Dr. Amanda Foster, an aviation psychologist, suggests that "the industry needs to balance strict enforcement with supportive intervention programs that encourage self-reporting and treatment."

The incident has sparked discussion within pilot communities about the effectiveness of current support systems. The British Airline Pilots Association (BALPA) has long advocated for enhanced mental health and wellbeing programs, arguing that creating a culture where pilots feel safe seeking help is crucial for maintaining safety standards.

For easyJet, this incident comes at a challenging time as the airline industry continues to navigate post-pandemic recovery, staff shortages, and industrial relations tensions. The carrier, which operates over 1,000 routes across 35 countries, has generally maintained a strong safety record throughout its 30-year history.

The Cape Verde authorities have confirmed that no criminal charges will be filed, as public intoxication is not a criminal offense on the islands. However, the pilot faces potential regulatory action from the UK CAA and almost certain termination of employment pending the airline's internal investigation.

This incident serves as a stark reminder of the aviation industry's ongoing challenges in maintaining the highest safety standards while supporting the wellbeing of its workforce. As one industry veteran noted, "Every incident, however rare, is an opportunity to strengthen our systems and ensure the traveling public's continued confidence in air travel."

The investigation continues, with findings expected to be reviewed by both easyJet's safety committee and relevant regulatory authorities. The airline has stated it will fully cooperate with all investigations and will implement any recommended changes to prevent similar incidents in the future.
